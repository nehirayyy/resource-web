                It’s difficult to provide a complete answer to this question as the histories, forms, and futures of the medium are divergent. LARP (Live Action Role Play) is semi-structured, improvisational theatre in the absence of an audience. The most often mentioned forerunners of role-playing games (RPGs) are probably Dungeons & Dragons (1974) and other tabletop games from the 1970s, which inspired players to create spontaneous stories until they were able to inhabit their characters and venture beyond of the proverbial basement. While some larping is consistent with the tradition of geeks slamming rubber swords into each other, other variations have developed at the same time. One of these variants is called Nordic larp since it originated in northern Europe. Nordic larp is the focus of this website. Nordic larps can borrow from many forms: historical reenactments, Gestalt therapy, dystopian simulations, complete abstractions, and more.

                We view the hyperrealistic depictions of a typical documentary format as <span style="letter-spacing: -0.01em;">punishment</span> –think of a fairly <span style="letter-spacing: -0.01em;">accurate</span> theatrical performance of the regular <span style="letter-spacing: -0.01em;">commute</span> <span style="letter-spacing: -0.01em;"> you make to work everyday.</span> This <span style="letter-spacing: -0.01em;">documentary</span> label –which commercial entertainers do not like– shows its characteristics in the most far-fetched world that the human imagines. In other words, in all of these fictional worlds, lies a taste for reality. This is the same logic that pulls the viewers of typical TV formats such as reality shows. So far fetched, yet full of documentary imagery in terms of presenting an accurate picture of the conditions under which they are created and the realities of a cutthroat society, where survival of the fittest and other such concepts are paramount… 
                <p id="secondWhyParagraph">
                In conclusion, larp: because it presents allegories of a sort of neoliberal natural state of being, not because they are connected to actual reality.

                <span style="letter-spacing: -0.01em;">Numerous in-game safety measures</span> have been designed in light of the possibility of emotionally <br>or even physically taxing content.While some examples—like inventively created methods of safely simulating sex—remain quite specific, others are now widely used. One such tool is a straightforward "OK" hand signal that players may use to convey to one another in-game to make sure a violent simulation isn't becoming too realistic.Though it may seem obvious that such improvements are needed, more conventional forms of role playing have only recently begun to include them. It's no coincidence that Nordic larp circles tend to be more diverse <br>than many gamer-worlds when it comes to things like gender and race. This variability reveals <br>all about the process by which game mechanisms come to be. Following the Gamergate online harassment campaign in 2014, which brought toxicity and bigotry in game culture to light, a group of progressive experience designers saw now as an opportune time to instill new value systems.The goal is to gradually replace the poison that arises from freedom and anonymity with reciprocal responsibility.

                Like any other world, the art world may be damaging to society. They are also not immune to the racism, opportunism, misogyny, and oppression that afflict other spheres of society. However, the reciprocal causality between artists' relationships with one another and the art they create is sometimes regarded as accidental or ambiguous, despite the fact that <br>it is <span style="letter-spacing: 0.02em;">increasingly acknowledged that poorly thought</span>  out game content reinforces harmful <span style="letter-spacing: -0.01em;">real-life</span>  circumstances <span style="letter-spacing: -0.02em;"> and vice versa.</span> While not all art has a participatory element, <span style="letter-spacing: -0.02em;">everyone</span>  participating in the conversation is a member of a social construct.

	Juhana Pettersson beautifully elaborates on the task of the designer as defined by Elvia Wilk; through his popular Nordic larp “Luminescence” –a game about music treatment for cancer patients. They try to accept the idea that they will all eventually die. In the game, being partially nude in a room full with flour is considered “normal.”

                <div id="thirdWriteParagraph">
	When Pettersson reflects on his work, he realizes that a game designer or a GM (Game Master) needs to be okay with wherever the game goes despite semi-planning it. Keeping this in mind; he also argues against an “item-card” method and believes in the match of reality and the reality of the game. In conclusion, <span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">while weirdness in and of itself frequently adds intrigue</span> to a game, it functions much better when it serves a purpose. 
	However, let this be an <span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">important take-away</span> from this section: you can borrow game mechanics.
